This project predicts future stock prices using Python and Machine Learning techniques. It uses historical market data to analyze trends and forecast possible price movements.

🚀 Features
	•	Collects and processes real-time stock data using Python
	•	Uses Machine Learning (Linear Regression / LSTM) for prediction
	•	Visualizes results with Matplotlib and Seaborn
	•	Web interface built using HTML and CSS to display predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
	•	HTML / CSS (for frontend visualization)
	•	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (for development and testing)

📊 Workflow
	1.	Import and clean historical stock data
	2.	Apply feature engineering and normalization
	3.	Train ML model on past data
	4.	Predict future prices
	5.	Display predicted trend through a simple web page

📈 Output
	•	Graph showing actual vs predicted stock prices
	•	Table summarizing prediction results
